The Image & Data Science group of LRCS laboratory/RS2E network, led by Arnaud Demorti√®re (Director of research at CNRS), is a multidisciplinary research team combining expertise in chemistry, physics, data science, and artificial intelligence. Our mission is to unravel the complex dynamic processes that drive degradation mechanisms in lithium-ion and sodium-ion batteries. To achieve this, we leverage cutting-edge experimental methodologies and state-of-the-art characterization tools.
 

Our core focus is to explore battery systems across various temporal and spatial scales, enabling us to gain a detailed understanding of structural, chemical and morphological properties as well as reactions at the nano/micrometric levels. By examining these processes in real-time, we aim to provide a precise and comprehensive view of the phenomena that affect battery performance and longevity.
 

In addition to our experimental efforts, we are at the forefront of developing advanced Deep Learning and AI-based algorithms. These algorithms analyze cycle curves, diffraction patterns, and multispectral imagery, revealing intricate correlations and patterns in the dynamic processes and degradation pathways. This data-driven approach is crucial for unlocking new insights into battery behavior, ultimately leading to innovations that improve the durability and efficiency of next-generation energy storage technologies.
